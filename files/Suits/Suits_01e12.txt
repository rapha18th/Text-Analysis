                			Okay. Bye. The least you can do is be honest with Jenny. That's what this is all about. Yeah. You always liked her. You kept flirting with me long after you started dating her. Yeah, well, that's going to stop. And while you're at it, no more running to me for favors or asking me for help. How about you find yourself some other paralegal? Because as far as I'm concerned, we're done. You haven't even gone to any law school. I'm working there. Oh, yeah. What, as a lawyer? It's a long story, okay? But you can't tell anyone, ever. This guy is not your friend. He is an anchor. He is my oldest friend. You were there. What would you do? I'd tell them everything. Watch Cameron go down. Sleep like a baby after I did it. Harvey would never use it, and he'd kill me if he knew I had it. But can you use this? To help him? Clifford Danner. He was 18. I put him in jail He's innocent. Cameron buried the evidence. Do you have enough to overturn? I don't know. So, what are you going to do? I'm going to get him out. Go. Go. No. That's not right. Right. I gave it to you backwards. I have to keep it interesting for myself. Security code. You know I know it. Why are you wasting our time? Because I want to make you work for it. Oh, really? Well, maybe I don't feel like working for it. Okay. All right. I'll just No, no. What are you doing? Showering. Oh, you don't trust me being here without you. No. I I trust you. I just You know, I like everything just so. Got you. Have a good day. Bye. Trevor. Jesus. Surprise. Can I come in? No. You Well, I'm late. So, we should, you know, grab a coffee on the way. Well, let me just take a piss first. No, don't. Trevor, stop. Stop. You've got a girl in there, don't you? Let's go. I'm just going to take a peek. Trevor, stop it. No, no. Stop. Stop. It's not even funny. Get your hand off the knob. Get your hand off the knob. We're going. I'll buy you breakfast. You're so serious. He loves you! Go. I got a job. Law firm mail room, of all places. Oh. I was wondering, think I could stay with you for a couple of days? Uh I don't really know if that's such a good idea. You know, I could have died that day. If it hadn't been for you and your boss. And I don't want to live that life anymore. I really don't. I don't have anybody else. Okay. And I was thinking, you know, maybe I'll try and call Jenny. Yeah. Yeah. You should. What are you doing here, Prosecutor? I believe you're innocent. You just find out you've only got six months to live? Because today isn't the day you get your conscience cleared. That's not the reason that I'm You know, I've been in here a dozen years. While Jason Black and Matt Bailey are out there living it up. You think I give a shit what you believe? You want to hit me? I want to kill you. But I lay a finger on you and they put me in the hole for 48 hours, extend my sentence. I got four years left. I ain't doing another minute than that. Good. Because I'm not here for your absolution. I'm here for your redemption. This is the letter I told you Jill wrote me. I know. The one you didn't believe existed. I believe it now. You were involved with her. This is the proof. Involved with her? I loved her. And she loved me. Then why did you keep this relationship a secret? Look at me, man. They gave me a scholarship to that school, but nobody wanted me dating anybody at that school. I had a record. If her father ever found out, I would have been done. They wouldn't have cared. Like you didn't care. Where did this come from? It was buried, but it got found. And this is why you believe I'm innocent. Yes. And this is enough to get me out? No. But that wasn't the only thing they buried. Jill's dress had your DNA on it. But there was another piece of clothing that had blood on it. A camisole. And they buried that because that DNA wasn't hers and it wasn't yours. Let me guess. It was Jason Black's. Unfortunately, I don't have access to his DNA. So, you finally going to go after him and Matt Bailey? I'm not a prosecutor anymore. Then what the hell are you here for? I want you to let me represent you. You think I'm going to trust you after what you did to me? I don't see anyone else lining up to get your ass out of here. See the money, wanna stay for your meal Get another piece of pie for your wife Everybody wanna know how it feel Everybody wanna see what it's like I'll even eat a bean pie I don't mind Me and missy is so early Busy, busy making money All right! All step back I'm 'bout to dance The greenback boogie What's that? It's an article where Clifford Danner took his plea. Do you want me to read it to you? No. ""Clifford Danner had a history of violence. ""This poor girl was brutally murdered at a high-end private school. ""And quote, 'This doesn't sound like the work of the squash team captain to me.""' I don't know, Harvey. This article makes a pretty compelling case that he's guilty. Well, he's not. It's quoting you. I was wrong. Jessica, I don't think you should let Harvey take this case. Louis. We're talking about a man's life. And if Harvey thinks the kid didn't do it, then so do I. I understand that. But what Harvey thinks and what Harvey can prove are two different things. In my experience with Harvey, it's one and the same. Listen to me. He was set up. Jill Hodgkins went to him and said that she was gonna turn in these two other guys for selling coke. They killed her and planted the coke in Clifford's room. I didn't buy his story because his DNA was on her. He claimed that it was because they were having this secret relationship, but he had no proof. And now, he does. Okay. I hate to disagree with you here, but I took a little poll of the partners Whoa. You did what? I was discreet. I assure you. And they feel, as I do, that Harvey's actions will hurt this firm. This firm? You mean my firm. And when you're running the firm of Litt, Nothing, and Nobody, then you can make whatever call you'd like. Until then, you can just get back to work. I'm telling you those guys did it. And as far as his violent history is concerned, you of all people are gonna tell me that a person can't change if they get a second chance? What do you need me to do? Hey. I need your help. I thought I made it clear that I don't expect to hear those words from your mouth ever again. It's important. It's always important. It's for Harvey. It's always for Harvey. He specifically asked for you. By name? He said he wanted the best. Well, if he didn't specifically name me and you didn't specifically tell him, then I am going to specifically decline. Rachel. Are you kidding me? Okay. I know that you're mad at me, but we are talking about a guy roughly our age who spent over a decade in prison for a murder that he didn't commit, and we are trying to get him out. Don't you think that's more important than our little Whatever? ""Whatever""? You know what I mean. Problems of two people, hill of beans. I don't know what you're talking about. Casablanca. Oh, I've never seen that movie. You No, it's old. Old. Oh, my God. Okay. What's your basis for getting him out? Prosecutorial misconduct? Buried evidence. Okay. Then, you need precedents to overturn. I already got those. Then what? I need to find out everything I can about the former DA's cases. Okay. Gone With the Wind? No. Citizen Kane? No. Dirty Dancing? ""Nobody puts Baby in the corner."" I can't believe you. I'm helping you. Come on, let's go. You thought to do this on your own? I decided to think like you. This is a high-profile murder case against the new District Attorney himself. You know that, right? I know. And you think I'm going to let you come with me for this, don't you? I know you are. You know, I don't want you thinking like me anymore. Now, you know how the rest of us feel. A-ha! Right there. I always would have said that. No, you wouldn't. Yes, I would. Harvey Specter. Terrance Wolf. That your case? I thought it best to cut a deal. Let him out for time served. High-profile murder at a prep school. No, I don't think I'll be cutting any deals. Miguel Ruiz, Lawrence Baker, Ray Jenkins, Calvin Reynolds. And who are these gentlemen? They're other cases with improprieties that we'll be forced to cite if we have to file to reopen. You of all people don't want that. Really? Why not? Because it will make you look bad. Didn't happen on my watch. You're supposed to be cleaning up the office. I find sunshine is the best disinfectant. Your mother teach you that? No, Harvey, life taught me that. This man is innocent. Then he should have gone to trial. Evidence was buried. Then dig it up and make your case. Mike. Give me a minute. Terrance, you're forcing me to do something that I'd rather not do. And what is that? Take this case on. I win. It's what I do. It will send a message around your entire office that you can't handle your business. Well, if I lose, I lose. That's the way the law works. But, Harvey, don't think I can't send a message or two myself. Rumor has it, you're the traitor who sold out his former boss. Wasn't me. Those rumors are wrong. So, mysterious evidence from back in the day of your old boss just appeared. You didn't know. Maybe it wasn't you. But it had to be somebody. Right, Harvey? Have a nice day. My office. Now. I have never thought about firing you. You took something when we quit the DA's office? Come clean right now or I'll let you go. Not give it a minute's thought. I knew it. You were in trouble. You had no right. I don't care. What did you do with it? She did what she had to do. She gave it to me. And the two of you saw fit to fight my battles for me? We did what you would have done for either one of us. So, get off your high horse. Leave the woman alone. We work because I've always known that I can trust you. Don't ever go behind my back again. You're welcome. Wait. He called you? Yeah. He left a message. What did he say? That he wanted to see me. And what did you do? I texted him and I told him I wasn't interested. We've got to tell him. No, we don't. Yeah, we do. I am already living a lie at work. I can't live one at home, too. Do you think that if you tell Trevor about us, he's going to keep your secret to himself? I know Trevor. If I tell him, he will take it up with me. If he hears it from someone else Who's gonna tell him? I don't know. Okay? I just I know that he's over there right now and it's drilling a hole in my brain. Then stay here. I can't. Why not? Because he came to me for help. Okay. Okay, what? Tell him. But please wait until he has his life back together. What do you mean? He came to you for help. How much help do you think hearing about us is going to be for him? Okay. Okay, what? Okay, I'll stay. Could you just not touch anything? Because I like my place just so. What? This place is a mess. What are you The court finds sufficient misconduct to warrant a new trial. Any pretrial motions at this time? Yes, Your Honor. The State advises that we will be seeking the maximum sentence of life in prison. What? Your Honor, my client has four years left. Mr. Specter, the state has every right to seek that penalty. Would you like to confer with your client before I vacate his conviction? Or you could just withdraw your motion right now. I'll confer with my client, Your Honor. Get the message? Four more years. Or you get out now. Or stay in the rest of my life. September 19th, 2007. What? His halfway point. I realized I could make it. You never said this could happen. He is sending a message. It's got nothing to do with you. It's got everything to do with me. What do you wanna do? What do you think? If we win, I want in. If we lose, I don't. We'll win. How do you know? Because I know. The same way you knew I was guilty? What do you think? I think Harvey wins his cases. What would you do? I'd trust him. Harvey, can you give us a minute? Clifford, I don't know you and you don't know me. But I'm going to tell you a story about what that man did for me and why I think you should trust him. Court is now in session. Mr. Specter. You going to withdraw your motion? Your Honor, my client wishes to proceed to trial. Gensync Chemical. They dropped us today. Louis' client? Louis' Fortune 500 client. You want to guess why? His ears? They freak a lot of people out. That was one client. His teeth? The fidgeting? It could be anything. Okay, stop it. Let me guess. One of the board members has a kid who went to this school. A daughter. And Louis correctly pointed out that they might not be the only clients that will punish us for taking this case. Which costs us money. Mmm. Louis is in the majority this time. Which hurts your position with the partners. You telling me to drop this? I'm telling you to win. But that's not why I called you in here. Have a seat. Donna. Mmm-hmm. You need to get over it. I'm trying. It's not that easy. Yes, it is. Tell me. Okay. Think about what your life would be like without her. Now, I know. Know what? How you always forgive me. Oh, it's nowhere near as easy to forgive you. Think about it. Oh, I do. Every goddamn day. Hey. Hey. We're starting trial today. I know. You've got five minutes. I've never started a trial without doing our thing. Well, you don't have time. There's plenty of time. You don't have time. I'm sorry. For what? Don't push it. Okay, let's go. We've got three minutes. Okay. Here or in my office? Here's good. Okay. On three. One, two Wait, let's go in your office. I'll get the can opener. Yeah. You left that in the kitchen. Thanks. I hate it when I do that. You don't have any numbers in your speed dial. I don't need them. And yet, you forgot your phone. It's not the same thing. Okay. Hey, Rachel. Thank you. For before. Sure. I mean, it was for Harvey. Yes. Yeah. Hey. Today's your first trial. What? I've been to trial before. Yeah, but not when you've been with me. Fair enough. Okay, I want to start a ritual with you. What do you want to do? We're on the phone. Remember that gymnastics video we saw? Yeah. I can get behind that. Feeling good? Never better. You? Oh, I'm ready to roll. Don't think I didn't see that can opener. What do you think you're doing, re-opening this case? Making sure an innocent man doesn't suffer for the crimes of others. What about Jill? Don't you care how she suffered? You two would know more about that than anyone, right? Excuse me? I bought the devastated friend act But I know better now. Mike, meet Jason Black and Matt Bailey. Just don't shake their hands. They've got Jill Hodgkins' blood all over them. Look, I don't know what you think you know, but when I'm done testifying, the jury's going to know that Clifford killed Jill. Just because you switched sides doesn't mean the rest of the world did. We just lost the letter. What? I didn't realize he'd have the nerve to lie on the stand. It's not exactly a giant leap from killing someone. Perjury and murder, they aren't the same thing. Yeah. Murder's worse. It's easier. Nobody's watching. Let's go. Mr. Black, what exactly did Jill tell you regarding the defendant? She told me she felt trapped. I thought she was talking about school. But now, I know what she meant. That letter was dated a week before she was killed. She must have broken up with him and this is how he paid her back. Mr. Black, you said you didn't see Jill Hodgkins at all on the day of the murder. Is that correct? Correct. So, there'd be no reason for your blood to be on any of her clothing at all. No, there'd be no reason. Would you be willing to have a DNA test, Mr. Black? Objection, Your Honor. Prejudicial. We'll pay for it, if that's a problem. Mr. Specter. It's about the DNA and they can't spin that. Detective Packel. The dress wasn't the only article of clothing that you submitted, was it? No. There was a camisole. Was it in your report? Yeah. If you bothered to read it. I did read it, Detective. And what was the DNA analysis on that camisole? I never picked it up. Why is that? Well, it wasn't ready until two days later. And we already had enough from the dress. Enough? A man's life is at stake. Enough for what? Enough for you to put him away without bringing it up for 12 years. Well, I did pick up that test, along with the camisole. Your Honor, I'd like to request a sidebar. On what grounds? The camisole and any evidence connected to it are inadmissible. This is bullshit. Easy. What? Your Honor, in between picking up the camisole at the precinct and dropping it off at the lab, you can see here the document is flawed. Therefore, the chain of possession with respect to the camisole was broken. You have to be kidding me. It's inadmissible. First six. What? The first six months are the hardest. In your mind. I don't know if I can do that again. Mr. Specter. You are accusing a police officer of tampering with evidence. Yes, I am. When the results of the DNA test came back, they didn't line up. And Detective Packel changed the custody documents. Even if Mr. Specter's assertions were true, it would automatically taint the evidence, anyway. He's got a point. That camisole was what allowed us to reopen this case in the first place. That camisole was proof that evidence was buried. That's why the case was reopened. An entirely separate issue from whether that evidence can be used in this trial. Clifford, I don't know what's going on in there, but no matter what they rule, he's not going to lose this one. You sure? Yeah. I am. Your Honor. - That's enough. I'm instructing the jury to disregard all testimony relating to either the camisole or the resulting DNA test. Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Get out of my face. What the hell are you doing, reopening this? You worried about getting caught intentionally tainting evidence? I didn't taint anything. What I did was help you put away a guilty man for brutally killing a young girl. And I'm not going to let you drag my reputation through the gutter. Not without consequences. Are you threatening me? Because the truth is, you wouldn't even be here if you hadn't done something wrong. Me. Yeah. It's all well and good for you to drag up shit from the past, huh? You're protected by your shiny suit, right? What are you talking about? Lawyers never go after their own. What is that Denzel movie? Tell it to me like I'm a five-year-old. Sometimes, the good guys got to do bad things to make the bad guys pay. It's time to start painting outside the lines. How? If Muhammad won't come to the mountain, we need to bring the mountain to Muhammad. Really? The mountain to Muhammad? It's a thing. Yeah. I know. It just has no meaning to me in this situation. You said you could think like me. Figure it out. Okay. Yeah. I got it. What is it? You tell me. I'll confirm. Nice try. Damn it. Why did you text me, Matty? We've got nothing to talk about. I didn't text you. You texted me. We've got to go. Yes. Come on. Does it really matter who texted who? Why not take advantage of the fact you get to see each other? Catch up. Talk about old times. Yeah, like that time that you murdered that girl and framed an innocent man. We didn't do anything. You're wasting your time. Am I? We know the truth. It's just a matter of time until one of you turns on the other one. The question is, who's it going to be? We were there today. You're the ones running out of time. Asshole. Looks like the rattlesnakes are starting to commit suicide. Holy shit. That's from Mississippi Burning. This whole idea is from Mississippi Burning. You know that movie? I was trying to stump you with that one. Front to back. Give me a break. The problem is those two don't seem like they're going to break. They know we don't have anything. Only now, we do. So, by the mountain to Muhammad, you meant DNA coming to Mr. Wolf. That's good. Hi, Donna. Hi, Louis. You're never I know. Why? I need a favor. You mean Harvey needs a favor. Oh, that's very astute of you. A big one. You know your cousin in the DNA lab? We need something today. No. It's for I know what it's for. What do you want? I don't want anything. I will fill in for Norma. Okay. I'm not being vindictive. I'm sorry. Do I have the right office? Listen to me. I want you, God damn it. And I would throw that secretary right out the window if I knew you were going to be my secretary. But I have a reputation that I value, and I'm not going to be putting my reputation on the line for something that I do not believe in American Ballet Theatre? No. Followed by a one-on-one dinner with Baryshnikov. Oh, mommy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. Mmm-mmm. Nope. I'm sorry. Okay. Can't do it. Got it. Okay? Mmm-hmm. Do you understand why? It's very clear to me. Do you know? Because Do you understand why I said no? I hear you, Louis. Louis Shh. I want to. But I can't. What? Let go. What? Let go. Jessica would like to see you in her office. Oh, that phony bitch. Call your cousin. It is not that simple. Yes, it is. You've compromised your principles before. Do it now. Like I told Donna, this isn't for me. This is for Harvey. Wrong. It's for me. Okay. You know, you want this so bad, why don't you maybe compromise your principles a little bit? Excuse me? Yeah. You know my billables. You talk about it all the time. ""Louis, you've got big billables."" You've seen my loyalty. Yet, you refuse to acknowledge my value. Where is this going? Where is this going? When you said Litt, Nothing, and Nobody, you know what that said to me? That said, ""Louis, you're never going to make senior partner."" Well, Harvey's running out of time. This is my leverage. I wanna make senior partner and I wanna make senior partner now. Louis, I do not respond to threats. I make them. So, if you ever want to be senior partner, you call your cousin. Now. All right. I don't need to see the results. I saw their faces. They did it. What happened to the letter? They made it seem like it didn't matter. Like, he was jealous. And so, he killed her. Well, I What? I'm just wondering, what would have happened if they hadn't kept their relationship a secret. I have to make a phone call. Okay. Jenny, hey. It's me. I can't keep this a secret from Trevor anymore. I need to tell him. Call me. DNA results. Jason Black and Matt Bailey. They match samples of the DNA taken from that camisole. They did it. Where did you get that? I found it. That doesn't prove anything. It's their blood on her. So, what? They could have had a gym class together or played flag football or any one of a hundred other reasons. Jason Black said he didn't see her that day. It's two specks of blood from what could easily be any other day. What's wrong with you? Me? You come in here with some unauthorized DNA test and right away, you expect me to just release a convicted felon into the streets. He didn't do it. And how can you allow him to sit in there while these two other murderers go free? Let me explain something to you. My job is to prosecute. Your job is to defend. I didn't bury any evidence. I didn't toss that DNA. The judge did that, based on fact. You're coming after me for the sins of someone else. This piece of paper here means nothing. So, unless one of those two boys just up and volunteer that they killed that girl, your client is going to go back to prison for the rest of his life. Terrance, you have a reputation as a fair man. I don't give a damn what other people think of me. I care about what I think of me. It didn't work. What's next? What's next is we have to put on a defense tomorrow. We got nothing. So, what are we going to do? I don't know. Ooh, Rachel. What are you doing in here? You have access to the Partners' kitchen. Yeah. I like to keep my finger on the pulse. Plus, they don't have Cheetos. Actually, I don't care about the pulse. Hmm. Okay. Either I am losing it or you are upset about something. So, what are you upset about? I don't want to talk about it. Got it. Mike Ross. How do you know that? I'm Donna. I know. Donna, what am I going to do? There's only one thing to do. Quit. Kill her? Well You need a drink. Yes. Two? We should barf. Take them off. Huh? Take them off. He's not an animal. I want to talk to him like a man. What happened? Wolf won't drop the charges. What? I tried everything. You tried. Look, we can cut a deal. We can ask for more time. He already said no way. We have got to Try? Try like you did with the DNA? I had four years. Four years of 16 that I only had in the first place because of you. Clifford, we Shut up. Why don't you take it out on me? What did you say? I said take it out on me. Harvey. I put you in there. I let you rot. I didn't give it a minute's thought for over a decade. Don't push me. Why not? I deserve it. It's my fault. You said it yourself. Harvey. They'll put me back in the hole. That's why not. Harvey, come on. And increase your sentence? It's going to happen, anyway. Guard. Come on. You know, Jason Black I said don't push me. and Matt Bailey, they killed Jill. Guard, get in here! And they are out there laughing their asses off Knock it off! You know what? No, come here! Get off of him! You tried? Let's go. You said you would get me out of here! Let's go. You said you'd get me out! What just happened? I just bought us 48 hours. Now, what? I'm going to beat the shit out of one of those guys and get him to rat on the other one. Which one? The weaker one. Which one is that? The one who didn't testify. You're serious. You can't do that. Who's going to stop me? Harvey, it wouldn't be admissible. You'll never get them that way. But it will get Clifford out. How? Wolf won't be able to deny that he's innocent anymore. Harvey, you don't do this. You can't beat people. That's not what you do. It is today. Harvey, stop. Listen, I've got another idea. What? You'll like it. It's from Mississippi Burning. Come on. So, all of these things are from clients? Yeah, pretty much. This pen. Remember that big Trump scandal you heard about last year? No. Exactly. Oh! Don't touch that. Signed by Patrick Ewing. He'll know. I'll never hear the end of it. All right. This one? Bird. He's from Boston. White man's hero. Hmm. Yeah, it's Kobe. He won't care. You really know him. I really do. No. Never? No. Ever? No. Never ever? No. Why not? Because you can never go back. I got to pee. Hey, man. I got your message. What did you want to talk about? It can wait. Do you remember when you said you would have died that day if it hadn't been for Harvey? Yeah. Well, he needs your help. Wake up, Matt. Shh! Who are you? What do you want? It's not who I am. It's who I represent. Jason Black. He knows you talked to the police. No, I didn't. I swear. Yeah, that's not my department. Now, Matt, you're going to retract what you said, you're going to leave town, and you're never going to talk to them again. Or next time, that's going to be your head. Somebody call the police? You. You What are you doing here? Hey, Matt. Relax. The detective was across the street the whole time. We knew Jason would send somebody. What? Who do you think told Jason you went to the police in the first place? I did. Harvey showed me the results of the DNA test. Two splotches. Jason Black's and yours. Okay. Um Uh I want to file a report. Oh. Sure. I'll take you downtown. You look through the books. Maybe you find something. Maybe you don't. But your real problem isn't that guy. It's Jason Black. Somebody was going to turn him in once before. And I think you know the lengths he'll go to to shut somebody up. No, I don't. No, I don't. We were here this time. We won't be here next time. Next time. What would have happened if he would have killed me this time? Well, you'd be dead and we'd have caught the guy and used him to put Jason away for murder. Shit, we should have done that. Yeah. Harvey, behave. What do you want? What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Confess to the crime. Turn in Jason Black. No. I can't do that. Yes, you can. I'll tell you why. You were 16. A juvenile. That's three years maximum. Less if you're the one who comes forward. We'll get you a deal. You can't make that promise. You're not the DA. You'd rather negotiate with Jason? Because he'll kill you and you know it. It was his idea. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. Okay. Get dressed. You're coming with me. Go. Hey, by the way, how did you get that bruise? Sometimes, the good guys got to do bad things to make the bad guys pay. To make the bad guys pay. That's right. What? ""What?"" You should have let me do the talking. Wouldn't work. You're not ready, yet. Not ready? This whole thing was my idea. You lost in housing court. You think you could handle a murderer? Mississippi Burning. You're welcome. I let you say the juvenile thing. That was pretty badass, wasn't it? Really? I thought I nailed it. Shower girl. Hey, Mike. It's Rachel. I know I shouldn't be doing this, and I know you're seeing Jenny but I can't stop thinking about the kiss. And I can't go back. Looks like one of them up and confessed. We'll get your client out.
